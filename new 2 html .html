<body><font size="20"><B><i> Republic Day is of great historical importance. We got freedom from the British on 15 August 1947, but we were not having any form of government or constitution or political parties. On 26th January 1950, India implemented the Constitution. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was elected as the President of Indian National Congress and Poorna Swaraj was declared on 26th January 1930. However, we got independence on 15 August 1947.

After independence, a special constituent assembly was appointed for making the Constitution of India. Dr B.R Ambedkar led the constitution drafting committee. While creating India’s constitution, other countries’ constitutions have also been referred to, so as to create the best constitution. After 166 days, the Constitution of India was finally made. It was created in such a manner that all citizens of India could enjoy equal rights pertaining to their religions, culture. On 26th January 1950, the Constitution of India was adopted and implemented, and the day is referred to as Republic Day. Moreover, it marks the end of the British rule and birth of India as a Republic State. </i> </B>
